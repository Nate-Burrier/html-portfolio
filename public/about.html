<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am currently a restaurant manager looking for a career change. I have been in the food service industry for almost 6 years
  and am ready for something new. I have always been interested in coding and how the internet works. I have quite a bit of customer
  service and management experience and I am hoping some of the skills I have learned will help me along the way. I plan to learn
  every day so that coding can become a full-time gig.

  I currently live with my girlfriend and our two dogs, Nola and Daisy. Nola is a beagle and she is a little over 4 years old. Daisy
  is a golden retriever and she just turned 7.
